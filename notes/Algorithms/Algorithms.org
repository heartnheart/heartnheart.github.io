#+DESCRIPTION: Notes about my learning Algorithms on Coursera
* Welcome to Algorithms, Part I (Week 0)
There is a course overview:

* Union Find problem
** Steps to developing a useable algorithm
1. Model the problem
2. Find an algorithm to solve it.
3. Fast enough? Fits in memory?
4. If not, figure out why.
5. Find a way to address the problem.
6. Iterate until satisfied.
** Dynamic onnectivity
Given a set of N objects:
1. =Union command*: connect two objects.
2. =Find/connected query=: is there path connecting the two objects?
** Modeling the connections
We assume "is connected to" is an equivalence relation:
1. Reflexive
2. Symmetric
3. Transitive.
** Connected Components
Maximal =set= of objects that are mutually
