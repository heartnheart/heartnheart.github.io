* Introduciton 
** What is machine learning
- Arthur Samuel (1959): *Field of study of that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.* 
- Tom Mitchel (1998): A Well-posed Learning Problem is *A computer program is said to learn from experience E with repsect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.
** Machine learning algorithms:
We mainly talks about *two types of algorithm*:
- Supervised Learning
- Unsupervised Learning
- Others: Reinforcement Learning, Recommender System.
And *Practical advice for applying learning algorithm*
*** Supervised Learning
"Right Answers" are given. 
**** Regression (Housing price prediction)
Predict continuous valued output (price)
