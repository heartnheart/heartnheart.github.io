#+DESCRIPTION: This blog describe a bug on Mac OS X with Code::Blocks 13.12

When using Code::Blocks, if you read a file using the following code:
#+begin_src cpp
  ifstream ifs("input.txt")
#+end_src
Then you =input.txt= should be the same directory as the executable file.
However, students using Mac OS report that they can't not find the file using
Code::Blocks.

The reason is that Code::Blocks didn't change the =current directory= to the
directory of the executable, but keep it remain in the home directory. A quick
fix could be going to =Settings= -> =Environment= and change the =Terminal to
launch console programs= to the following line:
#+begin_example
osascript -e 'tell app "Terminal"' -e 'activate' -e 'do script "exe=\'$SCRIPT\'; cd \\"${exe%/*}\\"; clear; \\"${exe% }\\""' -e 'end tell'
#+end_example

However, as the [[http://www.codeblocks.org/downloads/26][download page]] of Code::Blocks for Mac said, *Code::Blocks for
Mac is currently not as stable as are other ports, especially on Mountain Lion.*
So using it on Mac is not recommended.
